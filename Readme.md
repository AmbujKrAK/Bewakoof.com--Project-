# Clone of Bewakoof [https://www.bewakoof.com/]

Bewakoof is a lifestyle fashion brand that lets their customers have a hassle-free and convenient online shopping experience. As part of our project, we had to replicate the landing page, login/sign up, and the product pages, along with the ability to wishlist an item, add an item to the cart, and checkout using a coupon code.
